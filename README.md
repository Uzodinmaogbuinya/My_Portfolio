I’m a passionate Junior Developer with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I love building user-friendly websites and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in full-stack development through practical projects that highlight both my technical expertise and creativity. I’m enthusiastic about contributing to collaborative teams, learning from industry experts, and continuously growing as I build my career in tech.
